    content: `Copy-pasting content from Microsoft Word into a website seems convenient — until you look at the HTML. Bloated inline styles, mso- attributes, unnecessary <span> tags, and broken spacing are common side effects that negatively impact SEO, accessibility, and maintainability.

If you regularly publish blog posts, product descriptions, or long-form content created in Word, cleaning that HTML manually is frustrating and time-consuming. This guide explains why Word HTML is problematic, what clean HTML should look like, and how to convert Word content into SEO-ready HTML using the RosettaScript Word-to-HTML Converter.

## Why Word HTML Is Messy

Microsoft Word is designed for documents, not the web. When you copy content from Word, it brings along:

- **Inline styles** for fonts, spacing, and alignment
- **mso-* properties** meant only for Word
- **Deeply nested <span> tags**
- **Inconsistent list markup**
- **Broken spacing** around links and inline elements

This results in HTML that is:

- Hard to read and maintain
- Larger than necessary (hurts performance)
- Poorly structured for search engines
- Difficult to style consistently

## Why Clean HTML Matters for SEO

Search engines don't just read your text — they interpret your markup.

Clean, semantic HTML:

- **Loads faster** (better Core Web Vitals)
- **Improves crawlability** and indexing
- **Preserves heading hierarchy**
- **Improves accessibility** for screen readers
- **Makes future edits** safer and easier

Messy Word HTML can hide important content behind unnecessary tags, dilute semantic meaning, and introduce layout bugs that hurt user experience.

## What a Good Word-to-HTML Converter Should Do

A proper Word-to-HTML converter does more than remove formatting. It should:

- **Strip Word-specific styles** and attributes
- **Preserve meaningful structure** (headings, lists, emphasis)
- **Normalize spacing** and inline text
- **Handle links correctly**
- **Produce predictable, readable HTML**
- **Be safe to run multiple times** (idempotent)

Many online tools fail here by either over-cleaning (breaking content) or under-cleaning (leaving Word junk behind).

    content: `## Introduction

In an era where quantum computing threatens to break traditional encryption methods, the need for post-quantum cryptography has never been more critical. The **Random Universe Cipher (RUC)** represents a groundbreaking approach to symmetric encryption, designed specifically to withstand both classical and quantum attacks.

RUC is a symmetric block cipher that achieves **256-bit post-quantum security** through innovative design principles, making it one of the most secure encryption algorithms available today. This comprehensive guide explores what makes RUC unique, how it works, and why it matters for the future of data protection.

Try the RUC tool here: [rosettascript.github.io/tools/random-universe-cipher](https://rosettascript.github.io/tools/random-universe-cipher)

## What is the Random Universe Cipher?

The Random Universe Cipher (RUC) is a symmetric block cipher engineered for post-quantum security. Unlike traditional ciphers that may become vulnerable when quantum computers become mainstream, RUC is designed from the ground up to resist quantum attacks while maintaining exceptional security against classical cryptanalysis.

### Key Specifications

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Key Size** | 512 bits (64 bytes) |
| **Block Size** | 256 bits (32 bytes) |
| **Rounds** | 24 (fixed) |
| **Security Level** | 256-bit post-quantum |
| **Classical Security** | 512 bits |
| **Quantum Security** | 256 bits |

## Why Post-Quantum Security Matters

### The Quantum Threat

Quantum computers leverage quantum mechanical properties to solve certain problems exponentially faster than classical computers. **Grover's algorithm**, a quantum search algorithm, can theoretically break symmetric ciphers with a quadratic speedup:

- **AES-256**: Provides 256-bit classical security, but only 128-bit quantum security
- **ChaCha20**: Similar vulnerability to quantum attacks
- **RUC-256**: Maintains 256-bit quantum security through 512-bit keys

### Real-World Implications

As quantum computing advances, organizations need encryption that will remain secure for decades. RUC addresses this by:

1. **Future-Proofing**: Designed to resist quantum attacks
2. **Long-Term Security**: Suitable for protecting data that must remain confidential for years
3. **Regulatory Compliance**: Meets emerging post-quantum security standards

## Core Design Principles

RUC achieves its security through three fundamental cryptographic properties:

### 1. Confusion

**Confusion** creates a complex, non-linear relationship between the key and ciphertext. RUC achieves this through:

- **Galois Field (GF) Multiplication**: Byte-wise GF(2^8) operations provide algebraic complexity
- **Key-Derived S-Boxes**: 24 unique S-boxes generated from the master key
- **Dynamic Routing**: Selector-based register routing ensures key-dependent transformations

### 2. Diffusion

**Diffusion** ensures that small changes in input cause large, unpredictable changes in output. RUC implements diffusion through:

- **State Mixing**: 7 state registers (512 bits each) totaling 3,584 bits of internal state
- **Accumulator Combination**: 1,024-bit accumulator collects transformation results
- **SHAKE256 Extraction**: Final keystream generation ensures maximum diffusion

### 3. Security

**Security** refers to resistance against known cryptanalytic attacks:

- **24 Rounds**: Provides sufficient mixing for security
- **High Non-Linearity**: S-boxes with non-linearity ≥ 100
- **Large State**: 3,584-bit state resists various attack vectors

## Architecture Overview

### High-Level Data Flow

The RUC encryption process follows this flow:

\`\`\`
Key (512-bit) ──┬──> SHAKE256 ──> State Registers R[0..6]
                ├──> SHAKE256 ──> Selectors SEL[0..N]
                ├──> SHAKE256 ──> Round Keys RK[0..23]
                └──> SHAKE256 ──> S-Boxes S[0..23]

IV (256-bit) + State ──> mix_iv_into_state() ──> Initialized State

For each block:
  State + Selectors + Round Keys + S-Boxes ──> 24 Rounds ──> Accumulator
  Accumulator + Final State ──> SHAKE256 ──> Keystream
  Plaintext XOR Keystream ──> Ciphertext
  State ──> Feedback with Ciphertext ──> Updated State
\`\`\`

### Key Components

#### 1. State Registers

- **Count**: 7 registers (prime number ensures good mixing)
- **Size**: 512 bits each (8 × 64-bit limbs)
- **Total State**: 3,584 bits (448 bytes)
- **Purpose**: Hold evolving cryptographic state across rounds

#### 2. Operation Selectors

- **Count**: 16-31 selectors (key-dependent: 16 + (K[1] mod 16))
- **Type**: 16-bit odd integers
- **Purpose**: Determine transformation parameters and register routing
- **Ordering**: Permuted via key-derived Fisher-Yates shuffle

#### 3. S-Boxes

- **Size**: 256 entries per S-box (8-bit input → 8-bit output)
- **Count**: 24 S-boxes (one per round)
- **Properties**:
  - Non-linearity ≥ 100
  - Differential uniformity ≤ 4
  - Algebraic degree ≥ 7
  - Fixed points ≤ 2

#### 4. Accumulator

- **Size**: 1,024 bits (16 × 64-bit limbs)
- **Purpose**: Accumulate transformation results across all rounds
- **Operations**: Modular addition (mod 2^1024)

## How RUC Encryption Works

### Step 1: Key Expansion

The master key undergoes a comprehensive expansion process:

1. **State Register Generation**: Each of 7 registers is derived via SHAKE256 with unique domain separators
2. **Selector Generation**: 16-31 selectors are generated and permuted using ChaCha20-based Fisher-Yates shuffle
3. **Round Key Generation**: 24 round keys (512 bits each) are derived from the master key
4. **S-Box Generation**: 24 S-boxes are generated with cryptographic property verification

### Step 2: IV Mixing

The initialization vector (IV) is mixed into the state registers:

- IV is expanded to 512 bits using SHAKE256
- Mixed into each register with different rotations
- Cross-mixing ensures IV influence spreads across all registers

### Step 3: Round Processing (24 Rounds)

Each round processes all selectors in priority order:

1. **Destination Selection**: Compute target register using hash of state, selector, and round key
2. **Non-Linear Transformation**:
   - Extract byte from state register
   - GF multiply with selector-derived value
   - XOR with key-derived constant
   - Apply S-box lookup
3. **State Update**:
   - GF multiply entire register byte-wise
   - Shift and XOR result
   - Apply S-box to low byte
   - Rotate left by 1 bit
   - Mix with adjacent register
4. **Accumulation**: Add result to 1,024-bit accumulator
5. **Inter-Round Mixing**: XOR each register with adjacent registers

### Step 4: Keystream Generation

After 24 rounds:

- Combine accumulator (128 bytes) with all 7 state registers (448 bytes)
- Input to SHAKE256 with domain separator and block number
- Generate 32-byte keystream

### Step 5: Encryption

- XOR plaintext block with keystream to produce ciphertext
- Feed ciphertext back into state registers for next block

### Step 6: Decryption

Decryption is identical to encryption (XOR is its own inverse):

- Generate same keystream using same key, IV, and state
- XOR ciphertext with keystream to recover plaintext

## Security Analysis

### Quantum Resistance

**Claim**: 256-bit post-quantum security with 512-bit keys

**Analysis**:
- Grover's algorithm provides quadratic speedup: 2^512 → 2^256
- No known quantum algorithms exploit symmetric cipher structure beyond Grover
- Large state (3,584 bits) resists quantum collision attacks
- No algebraic structure exploitable by quantum algorithms

**Comparison**:

| Cipher | Key Size | Classical Security | Quantum Security |
|--------|----------|-------------------|------------------|
| AES-256 | 256 bits | 256 bits | 128 bits |
| ChaCha20 | 256 bits | 256 bits | 128 bits |
| **RUC-256** | **512 bits** | **512 bits** | **256 bits** |

### Differential Cryptanalysis Resistance

- **S-Box Differential Uniformity**: ≤ 4
- **Maximum Differential Probability**: 4/256 = 2^-6 per S-box
- **Full Cipher**: After 24 rounds with 17+ selectors per round, probability < 2^-256

### Linear Cryptanalysis Resistance

- **S-Box Non-Linearity**: ≥ 100 (out of maximum 120)
- **Full Cipher**: Best linear approximation bias < 2^-128 after 24 rounds

### Algebraic Attack Resistance

- **S-Box Algebraic Degree**: ≥ 7 (maximum for 8-bit)
- **Full Cipher**: Degree approaches 255 after multiple rounds

### Side-Channel Resistance

RUC implementations should use:

- **Constant-Time Operations**: Prevent timing attacks
- **Bitsliced S-Boxes**: Prevent cache-based attacks
- **Balanced Operations**: Reduce power analysis vulnerabilities

## Block Cipher Modes

RUC supports multiple modes of operation:

### RUC-CTR (Counter Mode)

- **Best For**: Parallel processing
- **Features**: Nonce-based, allows random access
- **Use Case**: High-performance encryption where parallelization is important

### RUC-CBC (Cipher Block Chaining)

- **Features**: IV-based, provides error propagation
- **Use Case**: Traditional block cipher applications

### RUC-GCM (Galois/Counter Mode)

- **Best For**: Authenticated encryption
- **Features**: Combines CTR encryption with GHASH authentication
- **Use Case**: Applications requiring both confidentiality and authenticity

## Cryptographic Properties

### Avalanche Effect

Changing 1 bit in plaintext flips approximately 50% of ciphertext bits. RUC achieves:

- **Target**: Average bit flip rate = 0.50 ± 0.01
- **Verification**: Tested across 1,000+ trials

### Key Sensitivity

Changing 1 bit in the key flips approximately 50% of ciphertext bits, ensuring strong key dependency.

### Branch Number

The mixing function achieves branch number ≥ 5, ensuring good diffusion properties.

### Algebraic Degree

After 24 rounds, the algebraic degree approaches 255 (practically maximum), providing strong resistance to algebraic attacks.

## Implementation Considerations

### Byte Ordering

All implementations use **big-endian** (network byte order) for:
- Integer to/from byte array conversion
- Key, IV, and ciphertext serialization
- SHAKE256 inputs

### Constant-Time Requirements

To prevent timing side-channel attacks:

1. **S-Box Lookups**: Use constant-time table access
2. **Conditional Operations**: Replace with arithmetic equivalents
3. **Modular Operations**: Use masking for power-of-2 moduli
4. **GF Multiplication**: Implement without early exits

### Memory Layout

- **State**: 448 bytes (7 × 64-byte registers)
- **S-Boxes**: 6,144 bytes (24 × 256-byte S-boxes)
- **Round Keys**: 1,536 bytes (24 × 64-byte keys)

### Optimization Opportunities

1. **GF(2^8) Lookup Tables**: Precompute 256×256 multiplication table (64 KB)
2. **SIMD**: Vectorize state mixing and GF operations with AVX2/AVX-512
3. **Parallel S-Box Generation**: Independent S-box generation across rounds
4. **Keystream Caching**: Precompute keystream for multiple blocks in CTR mode

## Use Cases

    content: `# How We Fixed Google Bot Crawling Issues and Improved SEO on Our GitHub Pages Site

## Introduction

As developers, we often focus on building great tools and features, but sometimes the biggest challenges come from infrastructure and deployment quirks. Recently, we encountered significant issues with Google bots being unable to properly crawl our website, leading to "Page not fetched" errors in Google Search Console. This blog post details our journey of diagnosing and resolving these issues, which involved canonical URL mismatches, sitemap inconsistencies, and GitHub Pages-specific behaviors.

## The Initial Problem: "Page Not Fetched" Errors

The first indication of trouble came from Google Search Console, which started reporting "Page not fetched" errors for many of our pages. These errors typically indicate that Google bots encountered issues when trying to access or render our content. Since our site is a React single-page application (SPA) deployed on GitHub Pages, we suspected the issue might be related to how client-side routing interacts with search engine crawling.

## Diagnosis Phase: Uncovering the Root Causes

### 1. Canonical URL Mismatches

Using Ahrefs' site audit tool, we discovered a critical canonical URL mismatch:

- **Static HTML** (raw HTML served by the server): \`https://rosettascript.github.io/tools/\` ✅
- **Rendered HTML** (after JavaScript execution): \`https://rosettascript.github.io/tools\` ❌

This mismatch occurred because our React SPA was dynamically updating canonical URLs at runtime, but many page components were passing canonical URLs without trailing slashes. Since GitHub Pages automatically redirects directory URLs without trailing slashes to URLs with trailing slashes (301 redirect), this created confusion for search engines.

### 2. Sitemap URL Inconsistencies

Further investigation revealed that our sitemap.xml contained URLs without trailing slashes, while:
- Canonical URLs in HTML had trailing slashes
- GitHub Pages serves directories with trailing slashes
- When Google crawled sitemap URLs without slashes, it encountered 301 redirects

Google Search Console flags these 301 redirects as "errors" when they could be avoided by using the correct URL format in the sitemap.

### 3. SEO Tag Optimization Issues

We also identified several SEO-related problems:
- Page titles exceeding 60 characters
- Meta descriptions exceeding 155 characters
- Missing structured data (JSON-LD)
- Inconsistent HTML output between static and rendered versions

## GitHub Pages-Specific Challenges

GitHub Pages has some unique behaviors that can complicate SEO:

1. **Automatic Directory Redirects**: GitHub Pages automatically redirects \`/path\` to \`/path/\` for directory URLs
2. **SPA Routing**: Client-side routing requires proper server configuration for direct access
3. **Static Generation**: Our Vite build generates static HTML, but React hydration can modify meta tags

These factors combined to create a perfect storm of crawlability issues.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Canonical URL Normalization

We implemented a robust canonical URL normalization system in our SEO component:

\`\`\`typescript
const normalizeCanonical = (url: string | undefined): string | undefined => {
  if (!url) return undefined;
  
  // Don't modify homepage
  if (url === "https://rosettascript.github.io" || url === "https://rosettascript.github.io/") {
    return "https://rosettascript.github.io/";
  }
  
  // Don't add slash to files
  const hasFileExtension = /\\.(xml|txt|html|json|ico|png|jpg|jpeg|svg|webmanifest|js|css|woff|woff2|ttf|eot|wasm|pdf|zip)$/i.test(url);
  if (hasFileExtension) {
    return url;
  }
  
  // Add trailing slash if missing (for directory URLs)
  return url.endsWith('/') ? url : \`\${url}/\`;
};
\`\`\`

This ensures consistency between static HTML and rendered HTML canonical URLs.

### 2. Sitemap URL Correction

We updated our \`scripts/generate-sitemap.js\` to add trailing slashes to all directory URLs:

\`\`\`xml
<!-- Tool Pages -->
<url>
  <loc>https://rosettascript.github.io/tools/word-to-html/</loc>
  <lastmod>2024-01-13</lastmod>
  <changefreq>monthly</changefreq>
  <priority>0.9</priority>
</url>
\`\`\`

### 3. SEO Component Enhancements

We enhanced our SEO component to:
- Truncate titles to ≤ 60 characters
- Truncate descriptions to ≤ 155 characters
- Add structured data (WebPage, SoftwareApplication, Article, NewsArticle schemas)
- Include DateModified in all structured data
- Prevent unnecessary DOM updates when content hasn't changed

### 4. Page Component Updates

We updated all page components to explicitly use trailing slashes in canonical URLs:
- Main pages: \`/tools/\`, \`/blogs/\`, \`/news/\`, etc.
- Dynamic pages: \`/blogs/{id}/\`, \`/news/{slug}/\`
- Tool pages: \`/tools/{tool-name}/\`

## Testing and Verification

### Automated Testing Scripts

We created comprehensive testing scripts to verify our fixes:

\`\`\`bash
# Test canonical URLs
node scripts/test-canonical-fix.js

# Test redirects
./scripts/test-redirects-curl.sh

# Check SEO requirements
npm run check:seo

# Local testing
npm run test:seo
\`\`\`

### Manual Verification Methods

1. **Ahrefs Site Audit**: Confirmed canonical URL consistency
2. **Browser DevTools**: Verified canonical URLs match between static and rendered HTML
3. **curl Commands**: Tested redirect behavior
4. **Google Search Console**: Monitored error resolution

## Results and Improvements

### Crawlability Improvements

- ✅ Eliminated "Page not fetched" errors
- ✅ Resolved 301 redirect errors in Search Console
- ✅ Consistent canonical URL signals
- ✅ Proper sitemap URL format

### SEO Enhancements

- ✅ All page titles optimized (30-60 characters)
- ✅ All meta descriptions optimized (120-160 characters)
- ✅ Structured data added to all pages
- ✅ DateModified timestamps included
- ✅ HTML output consistency between static and rendered versions

### Technical Benefits

- ✅ Faster indexing by search engines
- ✅ Improved search result appearance
- ✅ Better structured data for rich snippets
- ✅ Enhanced crawl efficiency

## Lessons Learned

### 1. URL Consistency is Critical

Inconsistent URLs (with/without trailing slashes) can severely impact SEO. Always ensure your canonical URLs, sitemap URLs, and actual served URLs are consistent.

### 2. Test with Real Tools

Don't rely solely on local testing. Use tools like Ahrefs, Screaming Frog, or Google Search Console to identify issues that only appear in production.

### 3. GitHub Pages Has Quirks

GitHub Pages' automatic redirect behavior requires careful URL management. Always test how your URLs behave on the actual hosting platform.

### 4. SPA SEO Requires Vigilance

React SPAs need special attention for SEO. Ensure your static HTML matches your hydrated content, especially for meta tags and canonical URLs.

### 5. Structured Data Matters

Adding proper JSON-LD structured data not only helps search engines understand your content but also enables rich snippets in search results.

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Ongoing Monitoring

We now regularly monitor:
- Google Search Console for crawl errors
- Ahrefs for canonical issues
- Page speed and Core Web Vitals
- Search ranking improvements

### Preventive Measures

- Automated build-time SEO checks
- Canonical URL normalization
- Structured data validation
- Regular sitemap updates

## Conclusion

Fixing our Google bot crawling issues required a systematic approach to diagnosing infrastructure, deployment, and SEO problems. By addressing canonical URL mismatches, sitemap inconsistencies, and SEO tag optimization, we not only resolved the immediate "Page not fetched" errors but also significantly improved our site's search engine visibility.

The key takeaway is that SEO issues often stem from seemingly minor inconsistencies that can have major impacts. Regular monitoring, comprehensive testing, and attention to detail are essential for maintaining good search engine relationships.

If you're experiencing similar issues with your GitHub Pages site or React SPA, we recommend:
1. Checking for URL consistency issues
2. Validating your sitemap format
3. Ensuring proper SEO tag implementation
4. Testing with professional SEO tools

Our tools are now fully crawlable and indexed, and we're seeing improved search visibility as a result. The journey taught us valuable lessons about the intersection of modern web development and search engine optimization.`,

    content: `## Introduction

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is the backbone of modern web development. Whether you're building APIs, handling configuration files, or processing data, working with JSON is a daily task for most developers. This comprehensive guide explores how to effectively format, validate, and optimize your JSON data.

Try the tool here: [rosettascript.github.io/tools/json-formatter](https://rosettascript.github.io/tools/json-formatter)

## Why JSON Formatting Matters

### Readability

When you're debugging or reviewing data, properly formatted JSON with indentation makes it significantly easier to understand the structure. Here's an example:

**Unformatted JSON:**
\`\`\`json
{"name":"John","age":30,"city":"New York","skills":["JavaScript","Python","SQL"]}
\`\`\`

**Formatted JSON:**
\`\`\`json
{
  "name": "John",
  "age": 30,
  "city": "New York",
  "skills": [
    "JavaScript",
    "Python",
    "SQL"
  ]
}
\`\`\`

The formatted version instantly reveals the data structure, making it easier to spot errors and understand relationships.

### Debugging

When something goes wrong in your application, being able to quickly read and understand JSON data is crucial. A good JSON formatter helps you:

- Identify syntax errors quickly
- Understand nested structures
- Find missing or extra commas
- Detect type mismatches

## Common JSON Errors and How to Fix Them

### 1. Trailing Commas

\`\`\`json
// ❌ Invalid - trailing comma
{
  "name": "John",
  "age": 30,
}

// ✅ Valid
{
  "name": "John",
  "age": 30
}
\`\`\`

### 2. Unquoted Keys

\`\`\`json
// ❌ Invalid - keys must be strings
{
  name: "John",
  age: 30
}

// ✅ Valid
{
  "name": "John",
  "age": 30
}
\`\`\`

### 3. Single Quotes

\`\`\`json
// ❌ Invalid - JSON requires double quotes
{
  'name': 'John',
  'age': 30
}

// ✅ Valid
{
  "name": "John",
  "age": 30
}
\`\`\`

## Minification vs. Formatting

### When to Minify

Minification removes whitespace to reduce file size. Use minified JSON when:

- Sending data over network (APIs)
- Storing in databases
- Configuration files for production
- Any bandwidth-sensitive scenario

### When to Format

Use formatted JSON when:

- Debugging and development
- Code reviews
- Documentation
- Teaching and learning

## JSON Validation Best Practices

1. **Always validate before processing** - Check for syntax errors
2. **Validate schema** - Ensure required fields exist
3. **Type checking** - Verify data types match expectations
4. **Size limits** - Set reasonable payload size limits
5. **Sanitization** - Clean data before using it

## Advanced JSON Operations

### Pretty Printing

Add customizable indentation:

\`\`\`json
{
  "name": "John",
  "age": 30
}
\`\`\`

### Minification

Remove all whitespace:

\`\`\`json
{"name":"John","age":30}
\`\`\`

### Sorting Keys

Alphabetically sort object keys for consistent output:

\`\`\`json
{
  "age": 30,
  "city": "New York",
  "name": "John"
}
\`\`\`

## Use Cases

### API Development

When building REST APIs, JSON is the standard data format. Proper JSON handling ensures:

- Reliable data transmission
- Easier debugging
- Better client-server communication

### Configuration Files

Many tools use JSON for configuration:

- package.json (npm)
- tsconfig.json (TypeScript)
- .eslintrc.json (ESLint)

### Data Storage

JSON is widely used for:

- NoSQL databases (MongoDB)
- Data interchange between services
- Log files and analytics

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Does formatting affect JSON validity?

No. JSON with whitespace is valid as long as the structure is correct. Formatting is purely for human readability.

### What's the maximum size for JSON?

There's no strict limit, but for web applications, it's best to keep JSON payloads under 1MB. Larger payloads should be paginated or streamed.

### Can I use comments in JSON?

No, JSON doesn't support comments. For configuration, consider using JSON5 or YAML instead.

    tags: ["Base64", "Encoding", "Data Transfer", "Web Development", "API"],
    content: `## Introduction

Base64 encoding is a fundamental technique in modern computing that converts binary data into ASCII text format. This allows binary data to be transmitted over media that only support text, such as JSON APIs, HTML emails, and URL parameters.

Try the tool here: [rosettascript.github.io/tools/base64](https://rosettascript.github.io/tools/base64)

## What is Base64?

Base64 is a binary-to-text encoding scheme that uses 64 ASCII characters (A-Z, a-z, 0-9, +, /) to represent binary data. It's commonly used for:

- Encoding email attachments
- Embedding images in HTML/CSS
- Transmitting binary data in JSON
- API authentication tokens
- Data URIs

## How Base64 Works

### The Base64 Alphabet

| Index | Char | Index | Char | Index | Char | Index | Char |
|-------|------|-------|------|-------|------|-------|------|
| 0     | A    | 16    | Q    | 32    | g    | 48    | w    |
| 1     | B    | 17    | R    | 33    | h    | 49    | x    |
| 2     | C    | 18    | S    | 34    | i    | 50    | y    |
| 3     | D    | 19    | T    | 35    | j    | 51    | z    |
| 4     | E    | 20    | U    | 36    | k    | 52    | 0    |
| 5     | F    | 21    | V    | 37    | l    | 53    | 1    |
| 6     | G    | 22    | W    | 38    | m    | 54    | 2    |
| 7     | H    | 23    | X    | 39    | n    | 55    | 3    |
| 8     | I    | 24    | Y    | 40    | o    | 56    | 4    |
| 9     | J    | 25    | Z    | 41    | p    | 57    | 5    |
| 10    | K    | 26    | a    | 42    | q    | 58    | 6    |
| 11    | L    | 27    | b    | 43    | r    | 59    | 7    |
| 12    | M    | 28    | c    | 44    | s    | 60    | 8    |
| 13    | N    | 29    | d    | 45    | t    | 61    | 9    |
| 14    | O    | 30    | e    | 46    | u    | 62    | +    |
| 15    | P    | 31    | f    | 47    | v    | 63    | /    |

### Encoding Process

1. Take 3 bytes of binary data (24 bits)
2. Split into four 6-bit groups
3. Map each group to a Base64 character
4. Add padding (=) if needed

**Example:**

\`\`\`
Input: "Hi"
Binary: 01001000 01101001

010010 000110 100100 (padded)

Output: "SGk="
\`\`\`

## Common Use Cases

### 1. Embedding Images in HTML

\`\`\`html
<img src="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgo..." />
\`\`\`

### 2. API Authentication

Many APIs use Base64-encoded credentials:

\`\`\`
Authorization: Basic dXNlcm5hbWU6cGFzc3dvcmQ=
\`\`\`

### 3. Data URLs

\`\`\`
data:text/html;base64,PGgxPkhlbGxvPC9oMT4=
\`\`\`

### 4. Email Attachments

SMTP servers use Base64 to encode binary attachments.

## Base64 in Different Programming Languages

### JavaScript

\`\`\`javascript
// Encode
const encoded = btoa("Hello");

// Decode
const decoded = atob("SGVsbG8=");
\`\`\`

### Python

\`\`\`python
import base64

# Encode
encoded = base64.b64encode(b"Hello").decode()

# Decode
decoded = base64.b64decode("SGVsbG8=").decode()
\`\`\`

### Node.js

\`\`\`javascript
const Buffer = require('buffer').Buffer;

// Encode
const encoded = Buffer.from("Hello").toString('base64');

// Decode
const decoded = Buffer.from("SGVsbG8=", 'base64').toString();
\`\`\`

## Best Practices

1. **Don't use for encryption** - Base64 is encoding, not encryption
2. **Handle encoding properly** - Use UTF-8 for international characters
3. **Validate input** - Check for invalid Base64 strings
4. **Consider size overhead** - Base64 increases size by ~33%

## Common Errors

### Invalid Characters

\`\`\`
❌ "SGVsbG8!"  // Contains !
✅ "SGVsbG8="   // Valid Base64
\`\`\`

### Incorrect Padding

\`\`\`
❌ "SGk"   // Missing padding
✅ "SGk="   // Correct padding
\`\`\`

## Conclusion

Base64 encoding is an essential tool for any developer. Whether you're building APIs, creating data URLs, or handling file uploads, understanding Base64 helps you work more effectively with binary data in text-based contexts.

    content: `## Introduction

URL encoding (also known as percent-encoding) is crucial for properly transmitting data over the web. Every developer needs to understand how to encode and decode URLs to handle special characters, spaces, and non-ASCII characters correctly.

Try the tool here: [rosettascript.github.io/tools/url-encoder](https://rosettascript.github.io/tools/url-encoder)

## Why URL Encoding?

URLs can only contain a limited set of characters:

**Safe Characters:**
- A-Z, a-z (letters)
- 0-9 (numbers)
- - _ . ~ (hyphen, underscore, period, tilde)

**All other characters must be encoded!**

This includes:
- Spaces
- Special characters (! @ # $ % ^ & *)
- Non-ASCII characters (émojis, accents)
- Reserved characters (/ ? & = :)


## How URL Encoding Works

### Percent-Encoding

Each character is converted to its UTF-8 byte sequence, then each byte is represented as %XX (hexadecimal).

**Example:**

\`\`\`
Space → %20
!     → %21
@     → %40
\`\`\`

### Reserved Characters

These characters have special meaning in URLs:

| Character | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| ?        | Query string separator |
| &        | Parameter separator |
| =        | Key-value separator |
| /        | Path separator |
| #        | Fragment identifier |
| :        | Protocol/port separator |

## Common Encoding Scenarios

### 1. Query Parameters

\`\`\`
Original: name=John Smith&city=New York
Encoded:  name=John%20Smith&city=New%20York
\`\`\`

### 2. Search Queries

\`\`\`
Original: what is JSON?
Encoded:  what%20is%20JSON%3F
\`\`\`

### 3. Paths with Spaces

\`\`\`
Original: /my documents/file.txt
Encoded:  /my%20documents/file.txt
\`\`\`

### 4. Special Characters

\`\`\`
Original: price=$99.99&sale=true
Encoded:  price%3D%2499.99%26sale%3Dtrue
\`\`\`

## URL Components and Encoding

### Scheme

\`\`\`
http:// → http://
https:// → https://
\`\`\`

### Domain

\`\`\`
example.com → example.com
\`\`\`

### Path

\`\`\`
/docs/readme → /docs/readme
/my file.txt → /my%20file.txt
\`\`\`

### Query String

\`\`\`
name=测试 → name=%E6%B5%8B%E8%AF%95
\`\`\`

## Common URL Encoding Mistakes

### 1. Double Encoding

\`\`\`
❌ Hello%20World → Hello%2520World
✅ Hello%20World   (don't encode already encoded)
\`\`\`

### 2. Using + for Spaces in Paths

\`\`\`
❌ /my+file.txt  (only valid in query strings)
✅ /my%20file.txt
\`\`\`

### 3. Not Encoding Special Chars

\`\`\`
❌ https://example.com/search?query=hello world
✅ https://example.com/search?query=hello%20world
\`\`\`

## Encoding in Different Languages

### JavaScript

\`\`\`javascript
// Encode
encodeURIComponent("Hello World!")  // "Hello%20World%21"

// Decode
decodeURIComponent("Hello%20World%21")  // "Hello World!"
\`\`\`

### Python

\`\`\`python
from urllib.parse import quote, unquote

# Encode
quote("Hello World!")  # "Hello%20World%21"

# Decode
unquote("Hello%20World%21")  # "Hello World!"
\`\`\`

### PHP

\`\`\`php
// Encode
urlencode("Hello World!");  // "Hello+World%21"

// Decode
urldecode("Hello+World%21");  // "Hello World!"
\`\`\`

## Best Practices

1. **Use encodeURIComponent()** for query parameter values
2. **Don't double-encode** already encoded strings
3. **Handle UTF-8** properly for international characters
4. **Validate URLs** before encoding
5. **Test edge cases** with special characters

## Conclusion

URL encoding is fundamental to web development. Proper encoding ensures your URLs work correctly across all browsers, servers, and international character sets.

    content: `## Introduction

Understanding color formats is essential for web designers and developers. Whether you're working with CSS, designing in Figma, or building a brand palette, knowing how to convert between HEX, RGB, and HSL color values makes your workflow smoother.

Try the tool here: [rosettascript.github.io/tools/color-converter](https://rosettascript.github.io/tools/color-converter)

## Color Formats Explained

### HEX (Hexadecimal)

The most common web color format. Uses # followed by 6 hexadecimal digits.

\`\`\`css
#FF5733  /* Red: 255, Green: 87, Blue: 51 */
#FFFFFF  /* White */
#000000  /* Black */
\`\`\`

### RGB (Red, Green, Blue)

Specifies color using values from 0-255 for each channel.

\`\`\`css
rgb(255, 87, 51)   /* Same as #FF5733 */
rgb(255, 255, 255) /* White */
rgb(0, 0, 0)       /* Black */
\`\`\`

### RGBA

RGB with an alpha (opacity) channel (0-1).

\`\`\`css
rgba(255, 87, 51, 0.5)  /* 50% opacity */
rgba(255, 87, 51, 0)    /* Fully transparent */
rgba(255, 87, 51, 1)    /* Fully opaque */
\`\`\`

### HSL (Hue, Saturation, Lightness)

More intuitive for humans. Hue is 0-360°, Saturation and Lightness are 0-100%.

\`\`\`css
hsl(14, 100%, 60%)  /* Same as #FF5733 */
hsl(0, 0%, 100%)    /* White */
hsl(0, 0%, 0%)      /* Black */
\`\`\`

### HSLA

HSL with alpha channel.

\`\`\`css
hsla(14, 100%, 60%, 0.5)  /* 50% opacity */
\`\`\`

## Converting Between Formats

### HEX to RGB

\`\`\`
#FF5733
→ FF (255), 57 (87), 33 (51)
→ rgb(255, 87, 51)
\`\`\`

### RGB to HEX

\`\`\`
255, 87, 51
→ 255 → FF, 87 → 57, 51 → 33
→ #FF5733
\`\`\`

### RGB to HSL

\`\`\`
rgb(255, 87, 51)

R = 255/255 = 1
G = 87/255 ≈ 0.34
B = 51/255 ≈ 0.2

Max = 1, Min = 0.2
L = (1 + 0.2) / 2 = 0.6 (60%)

S = (1 - 0.2) / (1 - |2*0.6 - 1|) ≈ 1 (100%)

H = 14° (approx)
→ hsl(14, 100%, 60%)
\`\`\`

## When to Use Each Format

### HEX

- **Best for:** CSS, quick prototyping
- **Pros:** Compact, widely supported
- **Cons:** Harder to mentally visualize

### RGB/RGBA

- **Best for:** Programmatic color manipulation
- **Pros:** Easy to understand channels
- **Cons:** Verbose

### HSL/HSLA

- **Best for:** Color palettes, themes
- **Pros:** Intuitive, easy to create variations
- **Cons:** Not supported in older browsers

## Creating Color Palettes

### Tints and Shades

Using HSL makes it easy to create variations:

\`\`\`css
/* Base color */
hsl(200, 100%, 50%)

/* Lighter (tints) */
hsl(200, 100%, 60%)
hsl(200, 100%, 70%)
hsl(200, 100%, 80%)

/* Darker (shades) */
hsl(200, 100%, 40%)
hsl(200, 100%, 30%)
hsl(200, 100%, 20%)
\`\`\`

### Complementary Colors

\`\`\`css
/* Base */
hsl(200, 100%, 50%)  /* Blue */

/* Complementary (opposite on wheel) */
hsl(20, 100%, 50%)   /* Orange */
\`\`\`

## Common Color Conversions

| HEX | RGB | HSL |
|-----|-----|-----|
| #FF0000 | rgb(255, 0, 0) | hsl(0, 100%, 50%) |
| #00FF00 | rgb(0, 255, 0) | hsl(120, 100%, 50%) |
| #0000FF | rgb(0, 0, 255) | hsl(240, 100%, 50%) |
| #FFFF00 | rgb(255, 255, 0) | hsl(60, 100%, 50%) |
| #000000 | rgb(0, 0, 0) | hsl(0, 0%, 0%) |
| #FFFFFF | rgb(255, 255, 255) | hsl(0, 0%, 100%) |

## Best Practices

1. **Use HSL for theming** - Easier to create consistent palettes
2. **Include fallbacks** - Provide HEX for older browsers
3. **Check contrast** - Ensure text is readable
4. **Use alpha** - Add transparency for overlays and effects

## Conclusion

Understanding color conversion between HEX, RGB, and HSL formats is a valuable skill for any web developer. Each format has its strengths—HEX for compactness, RGB for programmatic control, and HSL for intuitive color manipulation.

    content: `## Introduction

UUIDs (Universally Unique Identifiers) are essential for modern applications. They provide a reliable way to generate unique identifiers without requiring a central authority, making them perfect for distributed systems, databases, and microservices.

Try the tool here: [rosettascript.github.io/tools/uuid-generator](https://rosettascript.github.io/tools/uuid-generator)

## What is a UUID?

A UUID is a 128-bit identifier formatted as 36 characters (32 hex digits + 4 hyphens):

\`\`\`
550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000
\`\`\`

## UUID Versions

### Version 4: Random

Most commonly used. Generated using random numbers.

\`\`\`
550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000
\`\`\`

- 122 bits of randomness
- Virtually zero collision probability
- Perfect for most use cases

### Version 1: Timestamp-based

Generated using timestamp and MAC address.

\`\`\`
6ba7b810-9dad-11d1-80b4-00c04fd430c8
\`\`\`

- Includes timestamp and machine ID
- Can be sorted by creation time
- Less private (exposes MAC address)

### Version 5: Namespace-based

Generated using SHA-1 hashing.

\`\`\`
2ed6657d-e927-568b-95e1-2665a8aea6a2
\`\`\`

- Deterministic
- Based on namespace and name
- Useful for memorable identifiers

## Common Use Cases

### 1. Database IDs

\`\`\`sql
CREATE TABLE users (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  name VARCHAR(255)
);
\`\`\`

### 2. API Keys

\`\`\`json
{
  "api_key": "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
}
\`\`\`

### 3. Session IDs

\`\`\`
session_id=550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000
\`\`\`

### 4. Distributed Systems

\`\`\`
order_id=550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000
\`\`\`

## UUID in Different Languages

### JavaScript (Browser)

\`\`\`javascript
// Using crypto API (modern)
crypto.randomUUID()
// "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000"

// Using uuid library
import { v4 as uuidv4 } from 'uuid';
uuidv4(); // ⬅️ requires library
\`\`\`

### Python

\`\`\`python
import uuid

# Random UUID (v4)
uuid.uuid4()

# Namespace UUID (v5)
uuid.uuid5(uuid.NAMESPACE_DNS, 'example.com')
\`\`\`

### Node.js

\`\`\`javascript
const { v4: uuidv4 } = require('uuid');

uuidv4();  // "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000"
\`\`\`

## Best Practices

### 1. Use UUID v4 for General Purposes

\`\`\`
✅ 550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000
\`\`\`

### 2. Include Hyphens for Readability

\`\`\`
✅ 550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000
❌ 550e8400e29b41d4a716446655440000
\`\`\`

### 3. Consider Storage Impact

UUIDs are 36 characters—use VARCHAR(36) in databases, not CHAR(36).

### 4. Index Performance

For high-volume inserts, consider UUID v7 (time-ordered) instead of v4.

## UUID vs Other ID Strategies

| Method | Pros | Cons |
|--------|------|------|
| UUID v4 | No coordination needed | Not sortable |
| UUID v7 | Sortable, time-ordered | Newer, less supported |
| Auto-increment | Simple, compact | Requires central server |
| Snowflake | Sortable, distributed | Complex setup |

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Are UUIDs truly unique?

Yes. With 122 bits of randomness, the probability of collision is essentially zero (1 in 2^122).

### Are UUIDs secure?

UUID v4 uses random numbers but should NOT be used for security tokens. Use cryptographically secure random generators instead.

### Can UUIDs be shortened?

Not without losing uniqueness. Base64 encoding reduces length but increases collision risk.

## Conclusion

UUIDs are the go-to solution for generating unique identifiers in modern applications. They're essential for distributed systems, microservices, and any scenario where centralized ID generation isn't feasible.

Regular expressions (regex) are powerful patterns used to match character combinations in text. They're essential for form validation, text parsing, search-and-replace operations, and data extraction.

Try the tool here: [rosettascript.github.io/tools/regex-tester](https://rosettascript.github.io/tools/regex-tester)

## Basic Regex Patterns

### Character Classes

\`\`\`
[a-z]     Any lowercase letter
[A-Z]     Any uppercase letter
[0-9]     Any digit
[a-zA-Z]  Any letter
[a-zA-Z0-9] Any alphanumeric character
\`\`\`

### Special Characters

\`\`\`
.         Any character except newline
\\d        Any digit [0-9]
\\D        Any non-digit
\\w        Word character [a-zA-Z0-9_]
\\W        Non-word character
\\s        Whitespace

\`\`\`
*         0 or more
+         1 or more
?         0 or 1 (optional)
{n}       Exactly n times
{n,}      n or more times
{n,m}     Between n and m times
\`\`\`

## Common Regex Patterns

### Email Validation

\`\`\`regex
^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$
\`\`\`

Matches:
- ✅ user@example.com
- ✅ john.doe@company.org

### URL Validation

\`\`\`regex
^https?:\\/\\/[\\w.-]+(?:\\.[\\w.-]+)+[\\w\\-._~:/?#[\\]@!$&'()*+,;=.]$
\`\`\`

### Phone Number (US)

\`\`\`regex
^\\(?([0-9]{3})\\)?[-. ]?([0-9]{3})[-. ]?([0-9]{4})$
\`\`\`

### IP Address (IPv4)

\`\`\`regex
^(?:(?:25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?)\\.){3}(?:25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9])?$
\`\`\`

### Date (YYYY-MM-DD)

\`\`\`regex
^\\d{4}-(0[1-9]|1[0-2])-(0[1-9]|[12][0-9]|3[01])$
\`\`\`

## Capture Groups

### Basic Grouping

\`\`\`regex
(\\d{3})-(\\d{4})

Input: "555-1234"
Group 1: "555"
Group 2: "1234"
\`\`\`

### Named Groups

\`\`\`regex
(?<area>\\d{3})-(?<number>\\d{4})

Input: "555-1234"
area: "555"
number: "1234"
\`\`\`

### Non-capturing Groups

\`\`\`regex
(?:https?://)?(www\\.)?example\\.com

Matches with or without protocol/www
\`\`\`

## Lookahead and Lookbehind

### Positive Lookahead

\`\`\`regex
\\d+(?=px)

"100px" matches "100"
"100em" no match
\`\`\`

### Negative Lookahead

\`\`\`regex
\\d+(?!px)

"100em" matches "100"
"100px" no match
\`\`\`

### Positive Lookbehind

\`\`\`regex
(?<=\\$)\\d+

"$100" matches "100"
"100" no match
\`\`\`

## Regex in Different Languages

### JavaScript

\`\`\`javascript
const pattern = /\\d{3}-\\d{4}/;
const result = pattern.test("555-1234"); // true
\`\`\`

### Python

\`\`\`python
import re

pattern = r"\\d{3}-\\d{4}"
result = re.search(pattern, "Call 555-1234")
\`\`\`

### PHP

\`\`\`php
$pattern = "/\\d{3}-\\d{4}/";
$result = preg_match($pattern, "Call 555-1234");
\`\`\`

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Not Escaping Special Characters

\`\`\`
❌ user@example.com  (matches any character)
✅ user@example\\.com (escapes the dot)
\`\`\`

### 2. Greedy vs Lazy Quantifiers

\`\`\`
❌ "<.+>"    Matches "<b>bold</b>" as one match
✅ "<.+?>"   Matches "<b>" and "</b>" separately
\`\`\`

### 3. Not Anchoring Patterns

\`\`\`
❌ \\d{5}    Matches "12345" anywhere
✅ ^\\d{5}$  Matches exactly 5 digits
\`\`\`

## Best Practices

1. **Use comments** - Break complex patterns into readable parts
2. **Test thoroughly** - Check edge cases and invalid inputs
3. **Be specific** - Avoid overly broad patterns
4. **Use anchors** - Match whole strings when needed
5. **Consider performance** - Avoid catastrophic backtracking

## Conclusion

Regular expressions are incredibly powerful once mastered. They allow you to validate input, extract data, and manipulate text with precision. Practice with real-world examples to become proficient.

Cryptographic hash functions are fundamental to modern computing. They're used for password storage, data integrity verification, digital signatures, and blockchain technology.

This guide explains hash functions and shows how to use the RosettaScript Hash Generator tool.

Try the tool here: [rosettascript.github.io/tools/hash-generator](https://rosettascript.github.io/tools/hash-generator)

## What is a Hash Function?

A hash function takes input of any size and produces a fixed-size output (the hash). Good hash functions have these properties:

- **Deterministic**: Same input → same output
- **One-way**: Can't reverse the hash to get input
- **Collision-resistant**: Hard to find two inputs with same output
- **Fast to compute**: But expensive to reverse

## Common Hash Algorithms

### MD5

- Output: 128 bits (32 hex characters)
- Status: **Deprecated** - Not secure
- Use: Checksums only

### SHA-1

- Output: 160 bits (40 hex characters)
- Status: **Deprecated** - Vulnerable
- Use: Legacy systems only

### SHA-256

- Output: 256 bits (64 hex characters)
- Status: **Secure** - Recommended
- Use: Most applications

### SHA-512

- Output: 512 bits (128 hex characters)
- Status: **Secure** - High security
- Use: Maximum security needs

## Practical Use Cases

### 1. Password Storage

Never store plain text passwords—store the hash:

\`\`\`javascript
// When user creates password
const hash = sha256(password + salt);
// Store in database
\`\`\`

### 2. File Integrity

Verify files weren't tampered:

\`\`\`bash
sha256sum file.zip
\`\`\`

### 3. Digital Signatures

Sign documents using hash functions.

### 4. Git Commits

Git uses SHA-1 for commit IDs.

## Rainbow Table Attacks

Attackers pre-compute hashes for common passwords. Defense: add a salt before hashing.

## Using the Hash Generator

The RosettaScript Hash Generator supports MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512.

Hash verification is essential for ensuring data integrity. Whether you're checking downloaded files, verifying passwords, or validating data transfers, understanding hash verification protects you from corruption and tampering.

This guide covers hash verification and shows how to use the RosettaScript Hash Decoder tool.

Try the tool here: [rosettascript.github.io/tools/hash-decoder](https://rosettascript.github.io/tools/hash-decoder)

## What is Hash Verification?

Hash verification compares a calculated hash against a known hash to confirm data integrity and authenticity.

## Common Use Cases

### 1. File Verification

Download software and verify integrity:

\`\`\`bash
sha256sum -c software.zip.sha256
\`\`\`

### 2. Password Verification

Check if password matches stored hash:

\`\`\`javascript
const inputHash = sha256(password + salt);
if (inputHash === storedHash) { }
\`\`\`

### 3. Data Transfer

Verify transmitted data wasn't corrupted.

## Hash Types

- **MD5**: 128-bit, deprecated
- **SHA-1**: 160-bit, deprecated  
- **SHA-256**: 256-bit, recommended
- **SHA-512**: 512-bit, high security

## How to Verify

1. Get known hash from source
2. Calculate your hash
3. Compare the two hashes

## Common Mistakes

- Comparing wrong algorithm (SHA-256 vs MD5)
- Case sensitivity issues
- Encoding problems

## Using the Hash Decoder

The RosettaScript Hash Decoder supports MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512 with verification mode.

JSON Web Tokens (JWT) have become the standard for modern authentication and information exchange. They're used everywhere—from mobile apps to microservices.

This guide explains JWTs and shows how to use the RosettaScript JWT Encoder tool.

Try the tool here: [rosettascript.github.io/tools/jwt-encoder](https://rosettascript.github.io/tools/jwt-encoder)

## What is a JWT?

A JWT is a compact, URL-safe token that encodes claims as JSON. It's commonly used for:

- **Authentication**: Verify user identity
- **Authorization**: Grant access to resources
- **Information Exchange**: Secure data transfer

## JWT Structure

A JWT has three parts:

\`\`\`
header.payload.signature
\`\`\`

### 1. Header

Contains token type and signing algorithm:

\`\`\`json
{
  "alg": "HS256",
  "typ": "JWT"
}
\`\`\`

### 2. Payload

Contains the claims (data):

\`\`\`json
{
  "sub": "1234567890",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "admin": true
}
\`\`\`

### 3. Signature

Verifies the token wasn't tampered.

## Common Algorithms

- **HS256**: HMAC with SHA-256
- **HS384**: HMAC with SHA-384
- **HS512**: HMAC with SHA-512

## Using the JWT Encoder

The RosettaScript JWT Encoder lets you:

- Create new tokens
- Set header and payload
- Choose algorithm
- Sign with secret key

\`\`\`
header.payload.signature
\`\`\`

Each part is Base64URL-encoded.

## Decoding JWTs

\`\`\`javascript
const parts = token.split('.');
const header = JSON.parse(atob(parts[0]));
const payload = JSON.parse(atob(parts[1]));
\`\`\`

## What's Inside?

### Header

\`\`\`json
{
  "alg": "HS256",
  "typ": "JWT"
}
\`\`\`

### Payload (Claims)

\`\`\`json
{
  "iss": "https://example.com",
  "sub": "1234567890",
  "exp": 1700000000,
  "iat": 1699900000
}
\`\`\`
