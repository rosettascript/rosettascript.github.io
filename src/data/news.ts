    content: `## New Feature: Visual Heading Hierarchy in Word to HTML Preview

I'm excited to announce a major improvement to the Word to HTML converter that makes document structure instantly recognizable!

### What's New

The preview mode now displays **visual heading hierarchy indicators** that help users immediately see the structure of their converted documents. Each heading level (H1-H6) gets distinct visual cues without affecting the final exported HTML.

### Visual Features

#### Heading Level Labels
- **H1**: Red "H1" label positioned outside the text container on the left
- **H2**: Orange "H2" label positioned outside the text container on the left
- **H3**: Yellow "H3" label positioned outside the text container on the left
- **H4**: Green "H4" label positioned outside the text container on the left
- **H5**: Blue "H5" label positioned outside the text container on the left
- **H6**: Purple "H6" label positioned outside the text container on the left

#### Clean Text Display
Headings display with their natural typography (font size, weight) and small colored labels positioned completely outside the text container, ensuring absolutely clean text copying without any visual interference or spacing artifacts.

### Why This Matters

#### Better Document Structure Recognition
- **Instant hierarchy visibility**: No need to count heading levels manually
- **Improved content organization**: Perfect for blog posts, articles, and documentation
- **Enhanced user experience**: Makes the preview mode much more informative

#### Perfect for Content Creators
This feature is especially valuable for:
- **Content editors** preparing articles for publication
- **Technical writers** organizing documentation
- **Bloggers** ensuring proper heading structure
- **SEO specialists** verifying semantic HTML hierarchy

### How It Works

The visual indicators only appear in **preview mode** - when you toggle to the code view, you'll see the clean, semantic HTML without any extra markup. This ensures your exported content remains pristine while giving you powerful visual feedback during editing.

#### Toggle Control
A **heading visualizer toggle button** (with a hash icon) appears in the preview mode controls, allowing you to show or hide the heading labels as needed. This gives you full control over when to see the hierarchy indicators.

### Try It Now

1. Visit the [Word to HTML Converter](/tools/word-to-html/)
2. Paste some content with multiple heading levels
3. Switch to preview mode to see the new visual hierarchy
4. Toggle back to code view for clean HTML output

### Technical Details

- **Preview-only styling**: Visual cues don't affect exported HTML
- **Responsive design**: Works on all screen sizes
- **Theme-aware**: Adapts to light/dark mode
- **Copy-friendly**: No border lines that could interfere with text copying
- **Performance optimized**: CSS-only implementation with no JavaScript overhead

This enhancement makes the Word to HTML converter even more powerful for content creation workflows. The visual hierarchy makes it easier to spot structural issues and ensure your documents have proper heading organization.

    content: `## Patch 1.0.2 - Enhanced Shoppables Mode & HTML Cleanup

I'm excited to announce Patch 1.0.2, which brings significant improvements to the Word to HTML converter, particularly for Shoppables mode users.

### Bug Fixes

- **Fixed spacing checkbox default state**: The spacing checkbox in Shoppables mode is now correctly unchecked by default, allowing users to enable spacing only when needed.
- **Comprehensive BR tag removal**: All \`<br>\` tags are now properly removed from block elements (headers, paragraphs, lists) for cleaner, more semantic HTML output.
- **List item cleanup**: Fixed an issue where \`<p>\` tags were remaining inside list items. All paragraph tags are now properly unwrapped from list items.

### New Features

#### Shoppables Mode Enhancements

- **Spacing Rules checkbox**: Added a new "Spacing Rules" checkbox to Shoppables mode (unchecked by default). This allows users to enable spacing rules when needed, giving more control over the output format.

- **Add BR Before Read More**: New checkbox option to add \`<p><br></p>\` before "Read More", "Read Also", or "See More" sections. This is particularly useful for client pages that don't handle automatic spacing correctly.

- **Add BR Before Sources**: New checkbox option to add \`<p><br></p>\` before "Sources:" sections. Works independently of spacing rules and can replace existing \`<p>&nbsp;</p>\` spacers when spacing rules are enabled.

### Improvements

- Enhanced HTML cleaning pipeline with better BR tag removal
- Improved list item normalization
- Better handling of spacing elements in different contexts

### How to Use

1. **Hard refresh your browser** (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R) to load the latest version
2. Navigate to the Word to HTML converter
3. Select "Shoppables" output format
4. Explore the new spacing options in the Shoppables Features section

### Feedback

I'd love to hear your feedback on these improvements! If you encounter any issues or have suggestions, please let me know.
